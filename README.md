# binary-bomb-lab-guide

Carnegie Mellon University offers this exercise as a code file for students to practice their tracing skills.

Basic knowledge of assembly language and GDB commands is needed to understand this exercise.

This repo contains my notes and some tips on how to navigate the bomb lab.

It also contains a step-by-step sample solution.

Keep in mind that solutions are unique to each instance and my solution file would probably not work for your lab.
